#Python Introduction

#Python History –
Python was invented by Guido van Rossum in 1991.

#What is Python: -
1)	Python is a simple, general purpose, high level, and object-oriented programming language.
2)	Python is an interpreted scripting language. Which makes it attractive for Application Development.
3)	Python supports multiple programming pattern, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional or
procedural programming styles.

#Python New Versions – Python 2 vs Python 3

Differences – Python 2 is uses print as a statement and used as print “something” to print the some string.
Python 3 is uses print as a statement and used as print (“something”).

#Why Python – Python provides many useful features to the programmer.
Easy to use and Learn
Interpreted Language
Object-Oriented Language
Open Source Language
GUI Programming Support
Embeddable

#Where is Python used –?

Python is a general-purpose, popular programming language and it is used in almost every technical field.
Data Science
Date Mining
Desktop Applications
Mobile Applications
Software Development
Artificial Intelligence
Web Applications
Machine Learning

#Why they called python is an Interpreter Language

There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C and C++.
1)Directly run the program from the source code.
2)Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called byte codes which is then translated into
native language of specific computer to run it.
3)No need to worry about linking and loading with libraries, etc

#Features –

1)	Interpreted
2)	Platform Independent
3)	Free and Open Source
4)	High-level Programming
5)	Simple
6)	Embeddable
7)	Robust

#Advantages –
1)	Open source and community development
2)	Versatile, Easy to read, learn and write
3)	User-friendly data structures
4)	High-level language
5)	Dynamically typed language

#Disadvantages –
1)	Slow speed of execution compared to C, C++
2)	Irritating for C, C++ Programmers.

#Compile Time vs Run Time
Compile time - Compile time is the period when the programming code (such as C#, Java, C, Python) is converted to the
machine code. (Binary Code). – Statically Typed language.
Run Time - Runtime is the period of time when a program is running and generally occurs after compile time.
– Dynamically Typed language.

#Interpreted vs Compiled time programming languages. Explain in detail

A compiled language is converted into machine code so that the processor can execute it. An interpreted language is a
language in which the implementations execute instructions directly without earlier compiling a program into machine
language. The compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs.

# .py vs .pyc files

.PY files contain the source code of a program,
.PYC file contains the byte code of your program

Flavors of Python –
1)	CPython – It is the standards flavor of Python. It can be used to work with C language Application
2)	PyPy – JIT Compiler is available inside PVM
3)	Anaconda – It will handled large volume of data processing
